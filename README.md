When you open a file using Windows Explorer (e.g., double click from a folder/desktop or click and drag a file into this application's shortcut), this application automatically launches that year's Revit software release and opens the project in it. If the required Revit version is unavailable, the project will be loaded in the latest available version. Works with families, non-workshared projects, workshared local & workshared central projects up to Revit 2026 software.

( The download package includes Install executable, SILENT-INSTALL.txt & README.txt )

## Requirements
One of Revit 2019-2026 software versions installed
